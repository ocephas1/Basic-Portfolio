					<p> My name is Octavia Cephas and I am 26 years old. I grew up in New York City and graduated from Mount Holyoke College as a Theatre major, in 2013. I am currenlty a Relationship Manager at a prominent Financial Institution where I have worked for the past 4 years. Although I perform very well in my current role and often exceed the expectations of my direct managers, I have finally decided to take steps toward changing my career and becoming a web devloper.
				
			

					While I currently utilize many talents throughout the day, I am still left with a burning desire to <em>create</em>! I have always been a hands-on and creative person, and I ultimately want a career which will allow me to reflect that. I love technology and working with computers and I look forward to creating something I can be proud of. This portfolio is really exciting becuase it marks the beginning of my career as a web developer!</p>
